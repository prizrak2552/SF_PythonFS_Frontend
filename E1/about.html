          Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?. I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?. We're gonna
          have a problem here. Y'all act like you never seen a white person before. Jaws all on the floor like Pam like
          Tommy just burst in the door. And started whoopin' her ass worse than before.

          I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody, come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the
          storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just lettin' you know that you're not alone. Holla if you feel like
          you've been down the same road.

          As we go on another episode. Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place. That I once used
          to call home sweet home. Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road. As we go on another episode.

          And I am whatever you say I am. If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?. In the paper, the news, every day I
          am. Radio won't even play my jam. ‘Cause I am whatever you say I am. If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?.
          In the paper, the news, every day I am. I don't know, it's just the way I am.

          I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now who
          thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that
          hard, that hard. Everybody want the key and the secret. To rap immortality like I have got.

          Mom, I know I let you down. And though you say the days are happy. Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?.
          And, Mom, I know he's not around. But don't you place the blame on me. As you pour yourself another drink,
          yeah. I guess we are who we are. Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on. Maybe we took this too far.
